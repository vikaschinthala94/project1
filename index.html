    <center><img src="./Amma.jpg" alt="Mother's Love" width="30%" height="400"></center>
    <p>The word "Mother" resonates with blissful unconditional love and care that is the basic need of every child.
         The reasons for her existence in a child's life is endless and it applies to the entire living world of humans and animals. 
         The connect of children with mothers seems to be eternal as this bond starts way before birth.
         I am going to talk about my mother and why she is so special to me.</p>
         <h2>Her Love</h2>
    <p>My mother is an ordinary woman she is my superhero. In every step of my life, she supported and encouraged me. 
        Whether day or night she was always there for me no matter what the condition is. 
        Furthermore, her every work, persistence, devotion, dedication, conduct is an inspiration for me.
        She is an essence of truthfulness, love, and sincerity. Another reason is that she showers her family with her blessing and live. 
        Furthermore, she gives us everything but never demand anything in return.
         The way she cares for everyone in the family inspires me to the same in my future.</p>
        <h3>Why I Love My Mother So Much?</h3>
            <p>I love her not because she is my mother and we should respect our elders. 
            I respect her because she has taken care of me when I was not able to speak.
             At that time, she has taken care of all my needs when I wasn't able to speak.
            Additionally, she taught me how to walk, speak, and take care of myself.
            Similarly, every bigger step that I have taken in my life is all because of my mother.
             Because, if she hasn't taught me how to take small steps then I won't be able to take these bigger step.</p>
             <h4>Her Strengths</h4>
             <p>Although she is not physically very strong she faces every hurdle of her life and of the family too. 
                She motivates me to be like her and never submit in difficult times. 
                Above all, my mother encourages me to improve my all-round skills and studies. 
                She motivates me to try again and again until I get succeeded.</p>
                <h5>A Companion of Trouble</h5>
                <p>When I was afraid of the dark she would become my light and guide me in that darkness.
                     Also, if I can't sleep at night she would hold my head on her lap until I fell asleep.
                      Above all, she never leaves my side even in the hardest of times.
                      Every mother is special for her children. She is a great teacher, a lovely friend, a strict parent.
                     Also, she takes cares of the need of the whole family. 
                     If there is anyone out there who loves us more than our mother is only God. 
                    Not just for my mother but for every mother out there who lives her life for her family deserves praiseworthy 
                    applause.Mother's Day is celebrated on the Second Sunday in the month of May. It's celebrated to appreciate the hard work that our motherâ€™s do in their life. 
                    And the sacrifices that they make to keep their family happy.</p>
